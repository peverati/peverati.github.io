Research in our group is in the area of electronic structure theory and consists of two interconnected processes:

- We teach chemistry to the computer, by designing and implementing new theories into algorithms and computer programs.
- We use the computer to teach us back something about unknown chemistry. 

Applications are in every area of chemistry and include: studying reaction mechanisms in organic chemistry; designing of new materials for improved energy storage; designing of new drugs for new and improved therapies; understanding the evolution of chemical species in the environment and in the universe, and so on. 

For more information on what we are currently working on, visit the [Research page](/Research/) on this website.
