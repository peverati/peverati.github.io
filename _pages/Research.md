# Theoretical and Computational Chemistry

We are focused primarily in developing affordable computational methods with good accuracy for a broad spectrum of applications in chemistry and material science. Our theoretical starting point is the most widely used method for electronic structure calculations: Density functional theory (DFT). We are seeking for developments along two main lines: 

- **Database development:** development and analysis of databases with broad chemical purpose, using modern data-science techniques.
- **New DFT Functionals:** methods for strong correlation (B13 and derived functionals, quantum monte carlo extension of strong-correlation functionals), and methods that are more affordable and scale better with system size (orbital-free DFT and molecular-mechanics corrected DFT in affordable basis sets).

The rationale for the two lines presented above is the necessity to improve DFT for calculations that include transition metals. In this context, methods that scale better are important to expand our calculations to molecules of biological interests, while more accurate methods are necessary to treat correctly the multi-reference character (strong correlation) of most transition metals involved in such molecules. 

Applications are vast in scope and important in nature.

# Philosophy of Science
A recent interest of our group is the philosophy of science and education in chemistry. On this line of research, we focus on three important areas of the philosophy of chemistry:
The importance of models and simulations, and their relations with experiment and reality.
The description of emergent properties using simulations.
Pedagogical issues in theoretical chemistry: conveying complex theoretical concepts to experimental scientists vs. science students of different backgrounds.
